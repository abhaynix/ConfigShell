# `apps/server`

The ConfigShell API: a **read-only planning service** over the trusted catalog.

It answers two kinds of question — *what is in the catalog?* and *given this environment and
this selection, what should I run?* — and it has no other capabilities.

## What it does not do, permanently

**It never executes anything.** There is no `child_process` import anywhere in this
workspace, and an integration test asserts there never is one. A server that ran
package-manager commands on a user's behalf would be remote sudo, which the security model
rules out permanently rather than as a matter of sequencing.

Execution belongs to a local agent running on the user's own machine, which re-validates the
plan locally and asks for explicit confirmation before each privileged step. That component
does not exist — see [`docs/agent.md`](../../docs/agent.md).

It also has **no database, no authentication and no sessions**, because nothing here needs
one. The catalog is Git-managed data compiled into the process (PRD §33), and every endpoint
is a pure function of the request.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Returns |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| `GET` | `/health` (and `/api/health`) | Liveness and catalog integrity |
| `GET` | `/api/applications` | Browse, search (`?query=`), filter (`?category=`) |
| `GET` | `/api/applications/:id` | One entry; with `?distro=` also its resolution |
| `GET` | `/api/catalog/categories` | Supported categories |
| `GET` | `/api/catalog/environments` | Supported distributions, family, ecosystem, and resolver-computed catalog coverage |
| `GET` | `/api/catalog/roles` | Deterministic role/use-case presets |
| `GET` | `/api/catalog/roles/:id` | One preset |
| `GET` | `/api/catalog/stats` | Counts, computed from the data |
| `GET` | `/api/mcp` | How to connect an AI host: the public MCP URL, the tools, and what is withheld |
| `POST` | `/api/plan` | Selection + environment → plan, commands, manual steps |
| `POST` | `/api/plan/resolve` | Selection + environment → resolutions only |

`POST /api/plan` is a `POST` because its input is a selection rather than an identifier. It
is still a pure read: nothing is stored, nothing is mutated, nothing is executed.

### Example

```sh
curl -s localhost:3000/api/plan -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"environment":{"distro":"Ubuntu"},"applicationIds":["git","htop","cursor"]}'
```

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git htop
command -v git
command -v htop
```

…plus a manual step for Cursor, which is a vendor download and has no command.

## Responses

Success is `{ "data": … }`; failure is `{ "error": { "code", "message" } }` with an optional
`details`. Codes are a closed set (`utils/response.ts`): `INVALID_REQUEST`,
`UNKNOWN_APPLICATION`, `NOT_FOUND`, `REQUEST_TOO_LARGE`, `INTERNAL`. Switch on `code`;
`message` is for humans and may be reworded.

One line per request: method, path, status, duration and a correlation id. The path is
captured before routing — Express rewrites `req.url` on entering a mounted router, which
previously logged `/api/applications` as `/`. Query strings are dropped rather than logged.

Every response carries an `X-Request-Id`. A caller-supplied one is ignored — trusting it
would let a caller write arbitrary text into the server's logs.

## Security boundary

A caller supplies **catalog ids and a distribution name, and nothing else.** There is no
field for a package name, a command, a flag, a URL or a repository, so no request body can
introduce one. Defence in depth, in order:

1. `validators/plan.validator.ts` checks id *shape* against a slug pattern and *existence*
   against the catalog. An unknown id refuses the whole request rather than being skipped —
   a plan that silently omits what was asked for is worse than an error.
2. The ecosystem is always **derived** from the distribution, never accepted from the
   caller, so `{"distro":"Arch Linux","ecosystem":"apt"}` resolves as pacman.
3. Only a catalog source's own identifier reaches command generation.
4. `renderPlan` re-validates every identifier against a strict pattern immediately before
   interpolation, and throws rather than quoting anything suspicious.

Request bodies are capped at 16 kB and a selection at 200 ids.

## Relationship to MCP

`packages/mcp` does **not** call this API. Both are adapters over the same core
(`@configshell/catalog` + `@configshell/installer`), so a network hop between them would add
a failure mode without adding a guarantee.

That means nothing structural forces the two to agree, so it is asserted instead:
`packages/contract-tests` runs this app and the MCP tools side by side and fails if they
describe the same resolution differently. See [`docs/testing.md`](../../docs/testing.md).

## Logging

One JSON object per line (`utils/logger.ts`). Request bodies, query strings and selections
are **not** logged — the only environment data recorded is the distribution a caller asked
to plan for, which is what makes a resolution explicable afterwards. There are no secrets to
redact: the server declares no API keys, database URL or auth secret, and a test asserts it.

## Structure

```
src/app.ts                 Express app factory (no port binding)
src/index.ts               the only file that listens
src/config/                validated PORT / NODE_ENV — fails startup on a bad value
src/routes/                the full API surface, in one readable table
src/controllers/           validate → call a service → send
src/services/              catalog access and plan generation; no application data
src/validators/            the untrusted-input boundary
src/middleware/            request context, 404, error handling
src/utils/                 structured logger, response envelope
```

There is **no AI route and no authentication middleware**, not even as empty files — an
empty controller makes a repository look more complete than it is. AI is future scope, and
its intended shape lives in [`docs/ai.md`](../../docs/ai.md) where a design belongs until
there is code. There is nothing to authenticate yet: every endpoint is read-only and the
server holds no secrets.

## Running it

```sh
pnpm --filter server dev     # tsx watch
pnpm --filter server start   # tsx src/index.ts
pnpm --filter server test    # 53 tests
pnpm --filter server typecheck
```

The server is TypeScript that imports the workspace's TypeScript packages
(`@configshell/catalog`, `@configshell/installer`) directly. `tsx` transpiles them on the
fly, which is why there is no build step and no `dist/`. `tsconfig.json` extends the shared
`tsconfig.base.json` and is fully strict (`noImplicitAny` on): contract tests import
`server/app` into their own strict program — there are no declaration files for a build-free
workspace — so a loose annotation here would surface in *their* typecheck, not just this
package's.

The web dev server runs on 5173, so the two no longer collide. `pnpm dev` from the
repository root starts both.

## What the web app uses this for

`apps/web` calls **`POST /api/plan`** for setup plans and
**`GET /api/applications/:id?distro=…`** for per-source availability — everything the
resolver decides, and nothing else. It compiles `@configshell/catalog` into its bundle, so
browsing, search and role presets work with no server at all — simpler, faster, and with no
catalog-fetch path to intercept.

Plan generation is the deliberate exception. The web app could import
`@configshell/installer` directly, but that would put the one security-critical function in
the browser bundle and give two consumers two places to drift apart. One implementation, one
answer. The cost is visible rather than hidden: without this server you can browse and
select but not generate a plan, and the UI says exactly that.

In development, Vite proxies `/api` here (see `apps/web/vite.config.ts`), so the browser
stays on one origin and there is no CORS configuration and no credentials story.

The API is equally for consumers that cannot compile the catalog in — a CLI, an MCP server,
or any other client that should reuse resolution rather than reimplement it.
