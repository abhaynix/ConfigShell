/**
 * API routing table.
 *
 * Every route the server answers is listed here, which is the point: a reader
 * should be able to see the entire surface in one screen and confirm that
 * nothing executes, nothing writes, and nothing accepts free text destined for
 * a shell.
 *
 *   GET  /health                      liveness + catalog integrity
 *   GET  /api/health                  the same handler, reachable under /api
 *   GET  /api/applications            browse / search / filter
 *   GET  /api/applications/:id        one entry, optionally resolved for a distro
 *   GET  /api/catalog/categories      supported categories
 *   GET  /api/catalog/environments    supported distributions and ecosystems
 *   GET  /api/catalog/roles           deterministic role/use-case presets
 *   GET  /api/catalog/roles/:id       one preset
 *   GET  /api/catalog/stats           counts, computed from the data
 *   GET  /api/mcp                     how to connect an AI host to this deployment
 *   POST /api/plan                    selection + environment → plan + commands
 *   POST /api/plan/resolve            selection + environment → resolutions only
 *
 * That is the whole surface. Everything is read-only: no endpoint changes state
 * on the server or on the caller's machine.
 *
 * There is deliberately no AI route and no authentication route. Neither exists
 * as an empty file either — a placeholder controller makes a repository look
 * more complete than it is. The intended shape of the AI layer lives in
 * docs/ai.md, which is where a design belongs until there is code. MCP is a
 * separate integration layer over the same installer package (docs/mcp.md).
