/**
 * The Express application.
 *
 * Exported as a factory and kept separate from `index.js`, which is the only
 * file that binds a port. That split is what lets tests exercise the real app
 * without starting a listener or picking a port.
 *
 * ## What this server is
 *
 * A read-only planning API over the trusted catalog. It answers two kinds of
 * question — "what is in the catalog?" and "given this environment and this
 * selection, what should I run?" — and it has no other capabilities.
 *
 * ## What it is not, permanently
 *
 * It does not execute commands. There is no `child_process` import in this
 * application, and adding one would be a change to the security model rather
 * than a feature: a server that ran package-manager commands on a user's behalf
 * would be remote sudo. Execution belongs to a local agent on the user's own
 * machine, with local re-validation and per-step confirmation (docs/agent.md).
 *
 * It also has no database, no authentication and no sessions, because nothing
 * here needs one. The catalog is Git-managed data compiled into the process,
 * and every endpoint is a pure function of the request.
