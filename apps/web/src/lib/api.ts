/**
 * Client for the ConfigShell planning API.
 *
 * ## What goes over the network, and what does not
 *
 * **Browsing is local.** The catalog is compiled into this bundle from
 * `@configshell/catalog`, so search, filtering, categories and role presets work
 * with no server at all. That is the existing architecture and it is also the
 * safer one: there is no catalog-fetch path to intercept or poison.
 *
 * **Planning is remote.** Resolution, ordering and command generation happen in
 * `packages/installer`, reached through `POST /api/plan`. The alternative —
 * importing the installer into the browser — would work, but it would put the
 * one security-critical function in the bundle and give two consumers two
 * places to drift apart. One implementation, one answer.
 *
 * The consequence is honest and visible rather than hidden: without the API,
 * you can browse and select but not generate a plan, and the UI says exactly
 * that instead of silently degrading.
 *
 * Requests carry **catalog ids and a distribution name, and nothing else.** No
 * package name, command, flag or URL is ever sent — no such field exists.
