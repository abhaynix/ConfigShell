# Deployment — Docker, Docker Compose & Vercel

ConfigShell ships as production Docker images and a one-command Compose stack.
This document is the source of truth for the container layout, the runtime
graph, configuration, security, and how to validate a deployment. It describes
only what exists and is tested; see `docs/development.md` for local
development (which Docker is *not* part of).

## What gets a container — and why

The audit result first: the repository is a pnpm workspace whose runtime
surface is **one Express process** (`apps/server`) that already serves every
surface — the built web app, the `/api/*` read-only planning API, and the MCP
server over Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` (see `apps/server/src/app.ts`). That is
the architecture `pnpm build && pnpm start` runs, and Docker packages it
rather than replacing it.

| Package | Kind | Runtime home |
| ------- | ---- | ------------ |
| `apps/web` | static SPA build | bundled into the server image; also the nginx image in reverse-proxy mode |
| `apps/server` | runtime service (Express) | `configshell` image, port 3000 |
| `packages/catalog` | library (TypeScript source) | compiled into consumers; no container |
| `packages/installer` | library | compiled into consumers; no container |
| `packages/mcp` | library + stdio bin | HTTP surface inside `configshell`; stdio surface as `configshell-mcp` |
| `packages/test-utils` | test-only | never shipped |
| `packages/contract-tests` | test-only | never shipped |

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine ≥ 24 with the Compose plugin (or Docker Desktop).
- A shell. Everything below is exact; every command is part of the validation
  matrix at the end of this document.

The images are built against the frozen lockfile with exactly the pnpm declared
in the root `package.json` `packageManager` field (`pnpm@12.3.4`), so the same
dependency graph CI installs is the one the image resolves. No host
`node_modules` is ever copied into a build context — `.dockerignore` excludes
it — and no `.env` or other secret can enter an image.

## Quick start

Default mode — the whole product on one port, exactly like `pnpm start`:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/health
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Pick a different host port without touching code:

```sh
API_PORT=8080 docker compose up -d --build
```

Bring the stack down:

```sh
docker compose down
# also remove the (empty) project network:
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

## The three images

### `configshell` — the product, one container

`Dockerfile.vercel` at the repository root, built by the default
`compose.yml` **and** deployed as-is to Vercel — one image definition, so a
container host and the hosted deployment cannot run different builds. The
filename is the one Vercel detects; nothing in the image is Vercel-specific.
A two-stage build:

1. **build** — `node:24.21-alpine`, corepack-prepares `pnpm@12.3.4` from the
   `packageManager` field, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then `pnpm build`
   (Vite) to produce `apps/web/dist`. Manifests and the lockfile are copied
   first so dependency layers are cached until they actually change.
2. **runtime** — fresh `node:24.21-alpine`, production-only filtered install
   (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod --filter server...`), the built web
   bundle copied in, non-root `USER node`, exec-form `CMD`.

Why a second full stage rather than slimming the first: the runtime excludes
every dependency the tests, the linter and the bundler need, and never contains
a write to the store. `tsx` stays in production dependencies because the server
is TypeScript run under `tsx` with no build step — that is the repository's
documented choice, so the image ships exactly the runtime the code was designed
for.

### `configshell-web` — optional nginx front

`docker/web.Dockerfile` + `docker/nginx.conf`. Only rolled out with
`compose.web.yml` (reverse-proxy mode). It serves the identical `apps/web/dist`
bundle and reverse-proxies `/api/*` and `/mcp` to the `configshell` backend on
the internal compose network. nginx is used purely as deployment plumbing:
no business logic, no command vocabulary, no resolver policy.

### `configshell-mcp` — the stdio MCP tool

`docker/mcp.Dockerfile`. The same `createConfigShellServer()` that the HTTP
surface serves, bound to **stdio** — the transport an MCP host uses to launch a
local tool. It has no port and does not belong to a compose network; a host
would start it with `docker run -i` (see [MCP over stdio](#mcp-over-stdio)).
It installs the tool's full dependency branch including dev dependencies,
because the entry point is `tsx` — again, the existing runtime, packaged rather
than changed.

## Compose: default mode (one container)

`compose.yml` defines a single service that is the whole product:

- publishes `${API_PORT:-3000}:3000`,
- sets `NODE_ENV=production` and passes `PORT`, `MCP_PATH`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
  through,
- healthchecks `GET /health` with the container's own `node`,
- runs non-root with `no-new-privileges`, all capabilities dropped and a
  read-only root filesystem.

The stack is stateless by construction — the catalog is compiled into the
image, there is no database and no volume — so restart, `up -d` after a crash
and `down` + `up` all return you to the identical product.

## Compose: reverse-proxy mode (nginx front)

For operators who want a dedicated web tier rather than Express serving the
static bundle:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.web.yml up -d --build
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

In this mode:

- `web` (nginx) is the only published service (`${WEB_PORT:-8080}:8080`); the
  backend has **no host port** (`ports: !reset []`).
- `web` starts only after the backend is healthy (`depends_on: condition:
  service_healthy`).
- nginx serves the SPA with a fallback to `index.html`, long-cached hashed
  assets, and proxies `/api/*` plus `/mcp` to `server:3000` on the internal
  network. The browser stays on one origin, so no CORS configuration —
  identical to the default mode from the app's point of view.
- `MCP_PATH` must match what nginx proxies: the shipped `nginx.conf` proxies
  `/mcp`. Changing `MCP_PATH` means updating the nginx `location` block too —
  it is deployment topology, not business logic.

Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the public origin (https unless localhost) in this
mode so the MCP URL the backend advertises is reachable.

## Deploying to Vercel

Vercel builds `Dockerfile.vercel` from the repository root and routes all
traffic to the container — the *same* image Compose builds, so the hosted
deployment is the product, not a variant of it. One deployment serves the
website, the API and the remote MCP endpoint, because one Express process
already serves all three.

The container mechanism Vercel uses here is
[Container Images](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/container-images), which
is in **beta** and gated per account — a deploy fails with a permissions error
if the feature is not enabled for the team.

### Required project settings

Two environment variables must be set on the Vercel project (Settings →
Environment Variables), for the Production environment:

| Variable | Value | Why it is required |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Vercel connects to port **80** unless the project sets `PORT`. The image binds 3000 deliberately — binding a privileged port would mean granting this process a capability it must never hold. Without this, requests never reach the container. |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | the canonical https origin, e.g. `https://configshell.example` | Derives the public MCP URL the deployment advertises. Nothing routes on it, so a wrong value misreports a URL rather than breaking the server. |

`MCP_PATH` is optional and defaults to `/mcp`; set it only to mount the
endpoint elsewhere. `NODE_ENV` is already `production` in the image.

**`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is deliberately not defaulted from `VERCEL_URL`.** That
value changes with every deployment, so a user who copied it into an AI host
would find their connector broken by the next push. A canonical public URL is
an operator decision.

### Deployment protection

A Vercel project with **Deployment Protection** (Vercel Authentication) enabled
returns an SSO challenge to unauthenticated callers. An external MCP host is an
unauthenticated, server-to-server caller with no browser, so it cannot answer
that challenge: the endpoint must be reachable without it for Claude, ChatGPT
or any other host to connect. Either disable protection for production, or put
the canonical domain on an exempt custom domain.

### After deploying

Verify the MCP endpoint itself, not just that the site loads — an HTTP 200 from
`/` says nothing about the protocol:

```sh
# initialize handshake (a real MCP request, not a liveness check)
curl -sS -X POST "$PUBLIC_BASE_URL/mcp" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{
        "protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},
        "clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"0"}}}'
```

The repository's own check is stronger and is what should be trusted: connect
the **official MCP client** to the deployed URL and compare its answers with
stdio's. See [`mcp.md`](mcp.md#verifying-a-remote-deployment).

## MCP over stdio

The HTTP MCP surface needs nothing extra — it is served inside `configshell`
at `/mcp` (or `MCP_PATH`). The stdio surface is a separate tool an MCP host
launches as a subprocess:

```sh
docker build -f docker/mcp.Dockerfile -t configshell-mcp .
docker run -i --rm configshell-mcp
```

It logs its readiness to stderr and keeps stdout exclusively for protocol
messages. Tools are the same read-only, schema-strict surface the HTTP endpoint
serves: nothing that executes commands, no arguments that carry commands, and
the three capabilities the safety model withholds (`detect_system`,
`check_installed`, `execute_setup`) stay unregistered.

## Configuration

All variables are optional; the defaults run the stack as-is. Values reach the
container through Compose's `environment:` mapping, which reads your shell or a
repo-root `.env` (copy of `.env.example`). The server itself reads
`apps/server/.env` for non-Docker runs — `.env.example` there documents it.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | port the Express process binds inside the container (`0.0.0.0`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | validated against `development`/`test`/`production` |
| `MCP_PATH` | `/mcp` | HTTP MCP mount path; cannot collide with `/api` or `/health` |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | canonical public origin; only derives/display the MCP URL; https required unless localhost |
| `API_PORT` | `3000` | *host-side* published port in default mode |
| `WEB_PORT` | `8080` | *host-side* published port in reverse-proxy mode |

Secrets policy is unchanged from the rest of the repository: there are none.
No AI key, database URL, or auth token exists to configure, and `.env` files
are git-ignored. `.env.example` carries placeholders only.

## Security model in the container

The container enforces the repository's non-negotiable principles rather than
adding new ones:

- **Never in a position to execute.** The server generates installation
  commands as *text* and must never run one; it runs as the unprivileged
  `node` user, all capabilities are dropped, and `no-new-privileges` is set.
- **No remote sudo.** Execution belongs to the future local agent
  (`docs/agent.md`); nothing in any image invokes a package manager.
- **No secrets in images.** No `.env` or key file can enter the build context
  (`.dockerignore`), and there are no secrets to configure anyway.
- **Input limits unchanged.** Express caps request bodies at 16 kB; the web
  nginx config mirrors that.
- **Blast radius on the host.** The stack publishes exactly one port
  (default `3000`, or per-mode as above) and mounts no host directories. The
  catalog is read-only data compiled into the image.

The default server container also runs a read-only root filesystem. If an
operator needs to relax that (it is a hardening toggle, not a supported
feature), remove `read_only: true` from the service — the product does not
depend on it.

### Base image pinning and scanning

The server image builds on `node:24.21-alpine` (pinned to a Node minor, not a
floating `24` tag) so the vulnerability posture is reproducible instead of
changing with every base-image push. Node 24 is the active LTS line and the
version Vercel names as the migration target now that Node 20 is disabled in
project settings from 2026-10-01; because the deployment is a container, this
pin — not any platform default — is what the process actually runs. An
`npx trivy`-style container scan of the built images
reports only findings in the base image's **bundled `npm`** — `npm` ships inside
the Node alpine base but no ConfigShell runtime ever invokes it (package management
is pnpm via Corepack; the entry points are `pnpm`/`tsx`). The runtime
dependency tree that a container actually loads is clean: no OS-level findings
and none in the installed `.pnpm` store. The `configshell-web` (nginx + static
bundle) image reports zero findings. When a Node minor with fixes is released,
bump the `node:X.Y-alpine` pin in `Dockerfile.vercel` and `docker/*.Dockerfile` and rebuild; a future
npm-free base (e.g. distroless) would remove the bundled-npm surface entirely.

## Validation matrix

The container deployment is verified by exactly these commands on every
material change (the `check` CI job does not run them — they need a Docker
daemon, so they live here and in CI-on-schedule if GitHub Actions adds a Docker
job later):

```sh
# 0 — the repository's own checks, unchanged, must stay green
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build

# 1 — no host node_modules / .env leaks into any build context
docker build --check -f Dockerfile.vercel .               # requires BuildKit
docker compose config

# 2 — images build and inspect cleanly
docker compose build --no-cache
docker image inspect configshell:latest \
  --format '{{.Config.User}} {{.Config.Cmd}} {{.Config.WorkingDir}}'

# 3 — default mode: one container, whole product
docker compose up -d
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/health
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/                            # SPA HTML
curl -fsS 'http://localhost:3000/api/applications/git?distro=ubuntu'
docker compose ps                                           # healthy

# 4 — a real setup plan through the published surface
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/plan \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"environment":{"distro":"ubuntu"},"applicationIds":["git"]}'

# 5 — the MCP HTTP endpoint answers
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"0"}}}'

# 6 — graceful restart preserves the product
docker compose restart
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/health

# 7 — teardown
docker compose down

# 8 — stdio MCP container
docker build -f docker/mcp.Dockerfile -t configshell-mcp .
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"0"}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}' \
  | docker run -i --rm configshell-mcp
#   expect two JSON-RPC responses, the second listing the read-only tools

# 9 — reverse-proxy mode
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.web.yml up -d --build
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/api/health
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/plan \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"environment":{"distro":"ubuntu"},"applicationIds":["git"]}'
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.web.yml down

# 10 — optional security scan of the built images (trivy)
trivy image --scanners vuln configshell:latest
trivy image --scanners vuln configshell-web:latest
trivy image --scanners vuln configshell-mcp:latest
```

Checklist before a release: default mode up → healthy → plan generated →
restart survives → down; stdio container handshake→`tools/list`; proxy mode
web→`/health` and `/api/plan`; `docker image inspect` shows `User=node`,
exec-form `Cmd`, non-empty `WorkingDir`.
