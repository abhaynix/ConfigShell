# MCP interface

## Status: implemented, built on the official MCP SDK

`packages/mcp` is a working MCP server exposing **seven read-only, deterministic tools**,
plus two reference resources and one workflow prompt, over the trusted catalog and the
installer.

```sh
pnpm mcp        # or: pnpm --filter @configshell/mcp start
```

## What it is for

MCP is ConfigShell's **external integration boundary**. It lets an MCP-capable AI host —
Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, or anything else that speaks the protocol — use
ConfigShell's trusted capabilities to help a user discover, compare and choose software and
build a setup plan.

```
External AI host          reasoning, conversation, recommendations
        ↓  MCP protocol
ConfigShell MCP           adapters only — no business logic
        ↓
ConfigShell core
        ↓
Catalog · Resolver · Compatibility · Setup plan
        ↓
        results back to the host, which explains them to the user
```

**The division of labour is the point.** The host does the reasoning and the talking.
ConfigShell supplies verified data and deterministic operations, and contains no model, no
provider SDK and no API key. A question like *"I'm setting up Fedora for full-stack web
development, what should I install?"* is answered by the host calling `list_environments`,
`list_roles`, `search_application`, `get_application`, `check_compatibility` and
`generate_setup`, then explaining the results in its own words.

ConfigShell must not try to become the conversational AI itself, and AI/model integration
inside ConfigShell remains future scope ([`ai.md`](ai.md)).

## Built on the official SDK

The server uses **`@modelcontextprotocol/server` v2** — the official MCP TypeScript SDK,
which negotiates [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification) revisions
`2025-11-25` through `2024-10-07`. (`2025-11-25` is the newest the installed package
advertises in `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS`; the SDK's own README describes a later spec, so
check the package rather than the prose when this matters.)

The SDK owns the protocol: JSON-RPC framing, the initialize handshake, protocol-version
negotiation, capability declaration, `tools/list` and `tools/call` dispatch, JSON Schema
generation from our Zod schemas, argument validation, and error envelopes.

ConfigShell owns the business logic: the catalog, resolution, compatibility, setup plans and
the security policy. Protocol correctness is a solved problem maintained by the people who
write the spec; a trusted application catalog is not.

> **This replaced a hand-written JSON-RPC implementation.** That earlier decision was made
> against `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1, a monolithic package with seventeen transitive
> dependencies — HTTP transports, OAuth, and a process-spawning library. **v2 split the
> packages**, and a server now needs three: `@modelcontextprotocol/server`,
> `@modelcontextprotocol/core` and `zod`. The dependency objection no longer held.
>
> The compatibility argument settled it independently: the hand-written server negotiated
> protocol versions up to `2025-06-18`, two revisions behind what the SDK negotiates.
> Tracking a moving
> spec by hand is a maintenance burden with no upside, and every month it drifts further
> from what real clients expect.

## Transports: local and remote

The same `createConfigShellServer()` — identical tools, resources and prompts —
is served over two transports. There is no second tool surface and no second
copy of any business logic.

| | Transport | Entry point | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Local** | stdio | `packages/mcp/src/bin.ts` | a host that launches the server as a subprocess (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code) |
| **Remote** | Streamable HTTP | `packages/mcp/src/http.ts`, mounted by `apps/server` | a host that connects over HTTPS (Claude custom connectors, ChatGPT developer mode) |

```sh
pnpm mcp                        # local, stdio
pnpm --filter server start      # web + API + MCP on one port
```

Local HTTP endpoint while developing: `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

### Stateless by design

`createMcpHandler` is configured `legacy: 'stateless'`: each request is served
by a fresh instance, with `sessionIdGenerator: undefined`. Nothing is kept
between requests.

That is correct rather than a compromise. Every tool is a pure function of its
arguments over a compiled-in catalog — no conversation state, no cursor, no
subscription, nothing to resume. A session store would guard data that does not
exist, and it is what would otherwise force a database and pin the deployment
to one instance. Statelessness is why this runs on serverless infrastructure and
scales horizontally with no coordination.

### Configuration

The public MCP URL is **derived, never hardcoded**. No domain appears anywhere
in application source.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:<PORT>` | Canonical public origin. Must be `https` for any non-localhost host. |
| `MCP_PATH` | `/mcp` | Where the endpoint is mounted. Must not collide with `/api` or `/health`. |

```
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://configshell.dev
MCP_PATH=/mcp
                    -> https://configshell.dev/mcp
```

Changing the domain is an environment change and nothing else.

`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is deliberately **not** defaulted from `VERCEL_URL`: that
value changes every deployment, so a user who pasted it into an AI host would
find their connector broken by the next push.

### Connecting an external AI host

**Claude** — Settings → Connectors → *Add custom connector*, paste the URL.
Custom connectors are available on Free, Pro, Max, Team and Enterprise (Free is
limited to one). OAuth is optional; an unauthenticated server is supported. The
endpoint must be reachable from Anthropic's IP ranges.

**ChatGPT** — developer mode, under Workspace Settings → Permissions & Roles →
Connected Data. Requires a public HTTPS endpoint speaking Streamable HTTP;
authentication may be OAuth, none, or mixed.

Neither integration has been tested end to end from this repository. What has
been verified is the protocol: the official MCP client and the official MCP
Inspector both connect over Streamable HTTP, discover all seven tools and call
them successfully.

### Verifying a remote deployment

An HTTP 200 from `/` proves nothing about MCP: the website, the API and the MCP
endpoint are three different surfaces of one process, and only one of them
speaks the protocol. Verify the protocol.

The minimum real check is an `initialize` handshake:

```sh
curl -sS -X POST "$PUBLIC_BASE_URL/mcp" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{
        "protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},
        "clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"0"}}}'
```

A working endpoint answers with `serverInfo.name: "configshell"` and the
negotiated `protocolVersion`. The response is an SSE frame (`event: message`),
which is the Streamable HTTP transport behaving correctly — not an error.

The stronger check, and the one worth trusting, is the **official MCP client**
against the deployed URL, comparing its answers to stdio's. That is what
`packages/mcp/src/http.test.ts` does locally for every tool, every resource and
the prompt; pointing the same client at a remote URL extends it to a
deployment. The MCP Inspector (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`) does the
same interactively.

What to confirm, beyond "it connected":

- all **seven** tools are listed, and `detect_system`, `check_installed` and
  `execute_setup` are **absent**;
- both resources and the one prompt are listed;
- a real `generate_setup` call returns the same plan stdio returns;
- hostile arguments are still rejected — an identifier such as
  `git; rm -rf /`, an unknown application id, an unsupported distribution, and
  an unrecognised argument like `commands` must each come back as an error.

### Authentication status

**None.** The endpoint is public and read-only, which is the smallest safe
design for what it exposes: a verified catalog, deterministic resolution and
command *text*. There is nothing user-scoped to protect, no write path and no
per-user data, so an identity system would guard nothing.

Per-user secrets in URLs were considered and rejected — a URL is copied,
screenshotted and pasted into chat windows, which is the worst place to keep a
credential.

Adding authentication later does not disturb the tool layer: the SDK ships
`requireBearerAuth` and OAuth protected-resource metadata helpers, and the
transport is already a separate module from the tools.

## The tool surface

| Tool | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `list_environments` | Supported distributions and their package ecosystems |
| `search_application` | Search the catalog by text and/or category |
| `get_application` | One entry, its verified sources and who packages them; optionally resolved for an environment |
| `list_roles` | Deterministic role/use-case presets |
| `check_compatibility` | Resolve a selection against an environment, without building a plan |
| `generate_setup` | Ordered setup plan plus the commands a **user** would run |
| `validate_setup` | Check submitted commands against what the catalog produces |

Every tool is annotated `readOnlyHint: true`, `destructiveHint: false`,
`idempotentHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false` — the security posture stated in the
protocol's own vocabulary, where a host will actually read it, rather than only in prose.

Every tool returns **both** a JSON text block and `structuredContent`, so a host can parse
the result rather than re-reading prose.

Input schemas are Zod and **strict**: an unrecognised argument is rejected rather than
ignored. A host that invents a `command` field is told so, instead of receiving a plan that
silently dropped it.

### `generate_setup` produces a proposal, not an action

It returns commands for the **user** to run in their own terminal. Every result carries:

```json
"execution": { "executed": false, "executedBy": null, "note": "ConfigShell never runs these…" }
```

Privileged commands are flagged so a host can show which need root *before* the user agrees.
Applications needing a vendor repository, or shipping only as a vendor download, come back as
**manual steps with a link** — never a command that would fail on a clean system.

### `validate_setup` is a check, not an authorisation

It re-derives the plan from the catalog and compares the submitted commands, reporting
anything added, altered, dropped or reordered. Submitted commands are **compared only**:
never executed, never echoed back as approved. A pass is not permission to run anything —
whatever eventually executes must re-validate for itself ([`agent.md`](agent.md) rule 2).

## Resources and prompts

Added because they earn their place, not for completeness.

**Resources** (two): `configshell://reference/environments` — the supported distributions,
ecosystems, categories and role names as one small JSON document a host can read once instead
of spending a tool call; and `configshell://reference/safety` — what ConfigShell will and
will not do, for a host to consult before presenting commands.

The catalog itself is deliberately **not** a resource. `search_application` exists so a host
filters server-side rather than pulling every entry into its context.

**Prompt** (one): `plan_a_setup`, with optional `distro` and `useCase` arguments. A host can
discover the tools by itself, but the *order* — establish the environment before planning,
explain trade-offs before generating commands — is ConfigShell-specific knowledge worth
handing over explicitly. One prompt covers the product's main journey; more would be padding.

## What is deliberately absent

Three capabilities are **not tools**, and are not stubs that return an error either. A tool
that always fails is still a tool a caller must discover and handle; one returning a
plausible guess would be a lie.

| Capability | Why it is withheld |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| `detect_system` | Real distribution, architecture and desktop detection requires reading the user's machine. A server process is not on it. `list_environments` returns `detectionAvailable: false` and says to ask the user. |
| `check_installed` | Requires reading the user's package database. |
| `execute_setup` | Execution is the local agent's entire purpose, with local re-validation and per-step confirmation. **No MCP tool may run a command.** |

All three belong to the local agent ([`agent.md`](agent.md)), which does not exist.
`WITHHELD_CAPABILITIES` in `src/tools.ts` records them with reasons, and tests assert none is
ever registered or discoverable.

## Security boundaries

1. **No raw shell tool. Ever.** No `run_command`, no `exec`, no escape hatch.
2. **No tool takes an argument for a package name, a command, a flag, a URL or a
   repository.** A caller supplies catalog ids and a distribution name; nothing else can
   reach command generation because nothing else is read. A test walks the registered
   schemas and fails if such a field appears.
   Schemas are Zod and **`.strict()`**, so an unrecognised argument is refused rather than
   ignored. Shape, lengths, array bounds and the catalog-id pattern are all declared there:
   the SDK enforces them before a handler runs, and publishes them in the JSON Schema
   clients read, so a host can see the rules instead of discovering them from an error.
   `src/validate.ts` keeps only what a schema cannot express — catalog existence,
   deduplication, and building a validated `Environment`.
3. **Everything resolves against the trusted catalog.** An unknown id refuses the whole call
   rather than being skipped, so a plan always matches what was asked for.
4. **The package ecosystem is derived from the distribution, never accepted**, so a caller
   cannot pair "Arch Linux" with "apt" to steer command generation.
5. **Identifiers are re-validated** against a strict pattern immediately before
   interpolation, inside `@configshell/installer`, which does not trust this layer either.
6. **No execution, no filesystem, no sockets** anywhere in the package — asserted
   structurally over the source, along with the absence of package-manager command
   vocabulary, so this layer cannot fork command generation and disagree with the web app.

`validate_setup`'s `commands` is the one argument that accepts command text, and only to be
compared against catalog-derived output.

### Authorization

There is none, and none is needed yet: the transport is stdio, so the server is launched by
the user's own client as a subprocess with no listening port and no remote attack surface.
Per-capability authorization becomes a real requirement the moment either a remote transport
or a non-read-only tool arrives — which, per rule 4 above, means it arrives with the agent.

### Logging

Diagnostics go to stderr; stdout carries protocol messages alone. There is no audit log
because there is no security-relevant call to audit: every tool is read-only and the server
holds no credentials. A tool that could lead to a system change must arrive with one.

## Transport

**stdio today.** That is what MCP hosts use to launch a local server, and it is the whole
transport story for a local integration.

The boundary is drawn so a remote deployment is not a rewrite:
`createConfigShellServer()` returns a configured `McpServer` with **no transport attached**.
`bin.ts` binds stdio; a future HTTP entry point binds
`WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` from the same SDK package and registers the same
tools. Nothing in `tools.ts` knows how it is being reached — the tests prove it by binding
the same server to an in-memory transport instead.

**Streamable HTTP is not implemented**, deliberately. It would bring sessions, origin
validation and an authorization story, none of which has a user yet. The SDK ships it, along
with adapters for Express, Fastify, Hono and plain Node, whenever ConfigShell needs a
remotely hosted server.

**Today the server is local-only.**

## Connecting a client

Point an MCP host at the server command:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "configshell": {
      "command": "pnpm",
      "args": ["--filter", "@configshell/mcp", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

Compatibility is not a claim made from reading the spec: `src/integration.test.ts` connects
the **official MCP client** to this server over the real protocol, and `src/stdio.test.ts`
spawns the binary as a subprocess exactly as a host does.

## Where it lives

`packages/mcp` — a standalone server importing `@configshell/catalog` and
`@configshell/installer` directly. It does **not** go through the HTTP API: both are adapters
over the same pure functions, and a network hop between them would add a failure mode without
adding a guarantee. The same request produces the same result from the web app, the API and
an MCP client, because all three call the same code.
