# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**There are no releases yet.** The project is pre-1.0 and in active early development; the
version in `package.json` is `0.1.0` and has not been tagged or published. While the
version is below `1.0.0`, the public surface may change in a minor release — see
"Versioning" below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A `/connect` page on the site**, linked from the header as "Connect AI". It shows this
  deployment's MCP URL with a copy button, setup steps for Claude, ChatGPT and Cursor,
  example questions to ask once connected, the tools the assistant gains, the capabilities
  ConfigShell withholds and why, and the safety boundary. The MCP endpoint is the product's
  one shareable artifact — a user should be able to find it on the deployed site rather
  than in a README.

  It is at `/connect`, not `/mcp`: `/mcp` is the endpoint itself and a browser that visits
  it gets protocol frames, not a page.

- **`GET /api/mcp`** — the public MCP URL (derived from `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`), the transport,
  the authentication status, the registered tools and the withheld capabilities. The page
  reads this rather than hardcoding any of it: the URL is only known to the server, and the
  tool list belongs to `@configshell/mcp`, so a copy in the browser bundle would be a
  second source of truth that goes stale silently.

- **8 render tests for the connect page** (`ConnectView.test.ts`), using the same server-
  renderer approach as `PlanView.test.ts` — no DOM runner, no new dependency. They assert
  the page cannot invent a tool the server did not report, and that the withheld
  capabilities and the safety boundary are actually on the screen.

### Changed

- **Vercel is configured through `vercel.json` instead of a second Dockerfile.**
  `Dockerfile.vercel` is gone; `vercel.json` points Vercel's container build at the
  canonical root `Dockerfile` via `services.configshell.entrypoint`. One build definition,
  and the root `Dockerfile` is now the only container file in the repository.

### Removed

- **`docs/design.md`** — 264 lines of design tokens for "a dark, data-dense React component
  registry", complete with a logo URL on a third-party domain. It described a different
  product: none of its colours, fonts or surfaces appear anywhere in `apps/web`, which uses
  shadcn/ui with oklch tokens and Geist. Nothing referenced it, and a contributor reading
  `docs/` would have been actively misled about the design system.

- **`.agents/skills/design-system/SKILL.md`** — byte-identical duplicate of the `.claude/`
  copy.


### Changed

- **One container definition for every platform.** `Dockerfile.vercel` is now the canonical
  **`Dockerfile`** at the repository root — the filename Docker, Render, Railway, Fly and a
  plain VPS detect with no configuration. Vercel detects only `Dockerfile.vercel`, so that
  name survives as a **symlink** to `Dockerfile` (git mode `120000`), which keeps one build
  definition rather than two to drift. Verified by building the image through the symlink.

  Naming the canonical file after one platform was the wrong default: it made the generic
  path the special case. Nothing about the image is Vercel-specific.

- **`.env.example` reduced to variables that matter.** `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is the one that
  usually needs setting in production; `PORT` comes from the hosting platform, `MCP_PATH`
  defaults to `/mcp`. `WEB_PORT` is gone with the nginx tier.

- **`docs/deployment.md` rewritten** around two options — run it with Docker, or deploy the
  repository to a container platform — instead of a three-image catalogue. Vercel is
  documented as one supported platform, not a separate architecture.

### Removed

- **The nginx reverse-proxy tier** (`compose.web.yml`, `docker/web.Dockerfile`,
  `docker/nginx.conf`). It was a second implementation of routing the Express app already
  does, and it **hardcoded `location /mcp`** — so using it silently defeated `MCP_PATH`,
  the variable the deployment is configured by. Every real deployment target provides its
  own edge tier, so the overlay bought a duplicate of the routing table and a way to break
  the MCP endpoint.

- **The separate stdio-MCP image** (`docker/mcp.Dockerfile`). A second build definition for
  a transport that is a local developer tool: it had already drifted to `node:22.23-alpine`
  while the canonical image moved to 24, and it shipped dev dependencies. Local hosts run
  `pnpm mcp`; remote hosts use `/mcp` over HTTP. The `docker/` directory is now empty and
  gone.

### Fixed

- **`docs/deployment.md` validation commands could not have worked.** Every `/api/plan`
  example sent `"distro":"ubuntu"`, which the catalog rejects — distribution names are
  matched exactly (`"Ubuntu"`). The MCP handshake examples also pinned a stale
  `protocolVersion`.


### Added

- **The production image is deployable to Vercel.** `Dockerfile.vercel` at the repository
  root is the filename Vercel detects to build a project as a container, and it is the
  *same* image `compose.yml` builds — there is one production image definition, not a
  hosted variant that could drift from the local one. One deployment serves the website,
  the API and the remote MCP endpoint, because one Express process already serves all
  three. Requires `PORT=3000` in the Vercel project's environment variables: Vercel
  connects to port 80 unless told otherwise, and the image binds 3000 deliberately rather
  than take a capability it must never hold. See `docs/deployment.md`.

### Changed

- **`docker/server.Dockerfile` moved to `Dockerfile.vercel`** and the base image moved from
  `node:22.23-alpine` to `node:24.21-alpine`. Node 24 is the active LTS and the version
  Vercel names as the migration target now that Node 20 is disabled in project settings
  from 2026-10-01; a container carries its own runtime, so this pin is what the deployed
  process runs. The repository's `engines` field and CI matrix are a separate question and
  are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **`.env.example` had a block of stray text pasted into it** — eight lines of an
  interactive prompt's options, appended to the `# --- API server` comment header and
  continuing as non-comment lines. Harmless to `dotenv`, which ignores lines that are not
  `KEY=VALUE`, but the file is copied to `.env` by hand and documents the deployment's
  configuration, so it has to be readable. Removed; no variable changed.

- **Documentation counts no longer describe a catalog a fifth the current size.** The
  catalog holds **160 applications, 512 verified installation sources, 8 roles and 8
  categories**, with 141 carrying a verified binary name; `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `docs/catalog.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/testing.md` and `packages/catalog/README.md`
  all still said 31 applications and 116 sources. The openSUSE gap is restated with it: no
  entry carries a `zypper` identifier, so **52 applications have no route there at all**.

- **`README.md` said MCP does not exist.** It listed MCP alongside AI and the local agent
  as unimplemented, drew it that way in the architecture diagram, and described the
  transport as stdio-only — while `packages/mcp` has been a working server with seven
  tools over both stdio and Streamable HTTP. "Remote MCP over HTTP" also sat in the
  not-implemented list; what is actually missing there is authorization, not the transport.

- **The first good-first-issue sent contributors to add applications that already exist.**
  All nine it named as "obvious absences" — GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, Thunderbird,
  LibreOffice, Neovim, Audacity, OBS Studio, Kdenlive — are in the catalog. It now points
  at the real gap, which is openSUSE `zypper` identifiers.

- **`docs/deployment.md` described the nginx overlay on port 80.** The overlay moved to the
  unprivileged nginx image (UID 101, port 8080) and the document had not followed.


### Fixed

- **A selection is deduplicated by the plan builder, not by each adapter.** Asking for the
  same application twice produced `apt-get install git git` and two identical verification
  commands for any caller that reached `presentSetupPlan` directly. The HTTP validator and
  the MCP argument parser each deduplicated beforehand, so the rule lived in two transports
  and not in the one builder they share. It now lives with the plan; first occurrence wins,
  so caller order is unchanged. Reaching the API or MCP, nothing observable changes.

- **`renderPlan` refuses to build an install command with no packages.** An install step
  with an empty identifier list rendered as `sudo apt-get install ` — a command with no
  operand. `buildPlan` never produces one, but `renderPlan` is public API, and the
  finished-string allowlist accepts a trailing space, so nothing downstream would have
  caught it. It now throws, like every other fail-closed path in that module.

- **The plan validator catches an application that resolved into no install step.**
  `buildPlan` emits install steps only for the methods in its `methodOrder` list, which is a
  second place that has to know every installable method. Add a method and a trust tier and
  forget that list, and the application resolves, still counts as `installable` in the
  summary, and then vanishes from the plan — the one way "no application is silently
  dropped" could fail that the existing count checks could not see. Unreachable with the
  current install methods; now an error rather than a latent hazard.

- **Installation identifiers are validated at the catalog boundary.** `validateCatalog`
  checked `verify.binary` against a strict alphabet but never the installation identifier,
  although both are interpolated into a generated command. Command generation still
  re-validates immediately before interpolation and refuses to build a command — but only at
  plan time, as a thrown error on a user's request. A malformed identifier is now a
  validation failure, visible to the catalog test suite and to the `/health` integrity check.
  The real catalog was already clean; no entry changed.

- **`POST /api/plan/resolve` describes a resolution the way every other endpoint does.** It
  shaped its response inline in the controller, so it was the only place that omitted
  `applicationName` and `considered` — which sources were rejected and why — on the endpoint
  whose entire purpose is explaining resolution. It now uses the installer's
  `presentResolution`, like `GET /api/applications/:id?distro=…` and the MCP tools.
  **Additive for clients:** the two fields appear; nothing was removed or renamed.

- **Documentation counts and commands corrected.** `pnpm start` runs the API server (which
  also serves `apps/web/dist`), not the web workspace; `pnpm typecheck` covers every
  TypeScript workspace; `/api/catalog/roles` was missing from the route list in `CLAUDE.md`;
  test counts were stale in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/development.md`,
  `docs/testing.md` and `packages/installer/README.md`; and `docs/testing.md` still said
  "four supported distributions" after openSUSE was added. `docs/technical-audit.md` §9 Q4
  now records that its "Zypper out of scope" decision was superseded by the implementation.

### Added

- **Production deployment with Docker & Docker Compose.** Multi-stage, non-root images
  package the existing single-process architecture unchanged (web app + `/api/*` +
  `/mcp` in one container, mirroring `pnpm build && pnpm start`): `docker/server.Dockerfile`
  (the product), `docker/web.Dockerfile` (optional nginx reverse-proxy front, with
  `compose.web.yml`), and `docker/mcp.Dockerfile` (the stdio MCP tool for hosts that
  launch it as a container). `compose.yml` runs the product with a `/health` healthcheck,
  published-port override and the security posture (non-root, no-new-privileges, dropped
  capabilities, read-only rootfs); a root `.dockerignore` keeps host `node_modules` and
  `.env` files out of every build context; the pnpm version is pinned via the new
  `packageManager` field in `package.json` (Corepack/CI already depended on it); and
  `docs/deployment.md` documents the runtime graph, configuration, security model and the
  exact validation matrix. A new `apps/server/.env.example` documents what
  `src/config/env.ts` reads (it was referenced but missing).

- **The MCP `list_environments` tool reports catalog coverage**, the same resolver-derived
  counts `GET /api/catalog/environments` already returned. Without it an MCP host could not
  tell a well-covered distribution from one where the catalog has no native route — it would
  pick openSUSE for a user and then have to explain a plan built entirely from Flatpak and
  Snap. The cross-adapter test named "supported environments agree, including coverage" now
  actually compares coverage; it previously could not, because MCP returned none.

### Changed

- **The web app's shell and environment steps match the V1 design spec.** A new
  `AppShell` owns the page frame (the site header is now sticky), the page intro is its
  own `PageIntro` component, the environment card offers a "Detect again" action, and
  each role preset card carries its category icon. The selection panel's primary action
  is labelled "Generate setup plan", and privileged commands get a dedicated "Important"
  alert on the setup-plan page. No behaviour or data flow changed.

- **The API server is TypeScript and lives under `apps/server/src/`.** The Express app,
  routes, controllers, services, validators and middleware moved from `apps/server/*.js`
  into `apps/server/src/**/*.ts`, and the JS-with-JSDoc typechecking (an `noImplicitAny`
  opt-out) is gone: the server is fully typed and runs under the same strict shared
  `tsconfig.base.json` as every other workspace, so it typechecks under whatever program
  imports it — not just its own. No runtime behaviour changed; the endpoints, paths and
  `vercel.json` routing (now via `apps/server/src/vercel.ts`) are unchanged.

- **One canonical setup plan, built in one place.** `presentSetupPlan` in
  `@configshell/installer` now assembles the plan that `POST /api/plan` and the MCP
  `generate_setup` tool both return. Each adapter previously shaped its own, and the two had
  already drifted: the HTTP plan carried `summary.executed` while the MCP plan carried a
  richer `execution` block, and HTTP's `manualSteps` leaked the internal `kind` and
  `privileged` step fields that MCP's did not. The cross-adapter tests compared the fields
  both happened to share, so neither difference failed anything; they now compare the whole
  plan object.

  **Breaking, for API clients:** `summary.executed` is gone. The same fact is in
  `execution: { executed, executedBy, note }`, which both adapters now return.

### Added

- **Plan outcomes are visible in the UI.** The setup plan now states, at the top, whether
  every selected application produced a command — and the four things that can happen to a
  selection (installable, manual step, unavailable, runs as root) each carry a text label
  and an icon as well as a colour, so none of them is distinguishable by colour alone.
  Unavailable applications now show the outcome next to the reason instead of the reason
  alone. Four `--outcome-*` theme tokens back this, defined for light and dark, with every
  value measured against the surface it sits on (lowest is 4.7:1, AA).

- **`status` on the setup plan** — `complete`, `partial` or `none`, saying whether every
  selected application resolved to a command. A mixed selection is a partial success, not a
  failure, and the plan is returned in full either way. Previously a client had to derive
  this from the counts.

- **Plan self-validation.** `validateSetupPlan` runs on every generated plan before it is
  returned: the counts must add up, the privileged-command count must match the commands,
  and every command must match a narrow allowlist — checked on the finished string, after
  interpolation, which is the last point anything is observable. A plan that fails throws
  rather than being returned with a warning attached.

- **`packages/installer` setup-plan test matrix** — 18 tests covering single and multiple
  selections, all four ecosystems, partial success, an application with no route on a given
  distribution, an empty selection, byte-identical determinism across runs, each validation
  failure mode, and a hostile catalog entry.

- **`packages/contract-tests` — cross-adapter contract tests.** The HTTP API and the MCP
  server are sibling adapters over the same core; they do not call each other, so nothing
  structural made them agree. 12 tests run the real Express app and the real MCP tool
  handlers side by side and assert they agree on catalog contents, search, role presets,
  per-source resolution (including rejection reasons), generated commands across all five
  distributions, and every rejection path.

- **Zypper / openSUSE is a supported ecosystem.** The domain model, trust policy, plan
  generation and command generation all handle it, and a cross-ecosystem contract test pins
  the behaviour of all four package managers. **23 of 31 applications resolved on openSUSE
  immediately** — Flatpak and Snap are distribution-agnostic — so the previous decision to
  defer it (recorded as Q4) was based on a cost that turned out not to exist. Seven
  applications still need a verified `zypper` identifier; they are named in `docs/catalog.md`.
- **`catalogCoverage(environment)`** — installable / manual / unavailable counts per
  distribution, computed by running the resolver rather than stored, so it cannot drift.
  Published at `GET /api/catalog/environments`, which makes a thin distribution visible
  before a user picks it.
- **`DistroFamily`** (`debian` / `fedora` / `arch` / `suse`) on `Environment`, derived from
  the distribution alongside the ecosystem. Nothing resolves on it yet; it exists because
  adding a distribution should be a data change, and lineage is part of that data.
- **The dependency direction is now enforced, not just documented**
  (`packages/test-utils/src/architecture.test.ts`): no workspace may depend on a higher
  layer, the graph must stay acyclic, `packages/catalog` must depend on nothing, two edges
  are forbidden outright (`web → installer`, `ai → installer`), and package-manager command
  syntax must appear only in `packages/installer`. The first run caught `packages/ai` having
  no declared layer.

- **`pnpm start` now serves the whole product on one port.** `apps/server` serves
  `apps/web/dist` when a build is present, which is what the web app needs: it calls the API
  for anything the resolver decides, so the two must share an origin. Previously the built
  web app was served by its own process with no API behind it, so in production the setup-plan
  step and per-source availability both failed. Four regression tests cover it, including
  that the SPA fallback never shadows `/api` or `/health`.
- `docs/testing.md` — the authority on what is tested, the security test cases, and an honest
  list of what is **not** (no DOM tests, no e2e, no coverage threshold). README and
  `development.md` now link to it instead of each describing testing separately.

- **MCP resources and a prompt.** Two reference resources
  (`configshell://reference/environments`, `configshell://reference/safety`) give an AI host
  static context in one read instead of a tool call, and the `plan_a_setup` prompt hands over
  the intended workflow order. The catalog itself is deliberately not a resource —
  `search_application` exists so a host filters server-side.
- **`packages/mcp` — an MCP server over stdio.** Seven read-only, deterministic tools over
  the trusted catalog and the installer: `list_environments`, `search_application`,
  `get_application`, `list_roles`, `check_compatibility`, `generate_setup` and
  `validate_setup`. A thin adapter — every decision comes from `@configshell/installer`, so
  an MCP client cannot get a different answer from the web app or the API, and a test asserts
  the package-manager vocabulary never appears in the package.
  - **`detect_system`, `check_installed` and `execute_setup` are deliberately absent, not
    stubbed.** All three require the local agent. A tool that always fails is still a tool a
    caller must discover and handle; one returning a plausible guess would be a lie. Their
    reasons are recorded in `WITHHELD_CAPABILITIES` and asserted by test.
  - **No tool takes an argument for a package name, a command, a flag, a URL or a
    repository** — a caller supplies catalog ids and a distribution name, and a test walks
    the registered schemas to keep it that way. `validate_setup` accepts command text only to
    *compare* it against catalog-derived output; it never executes or re-emits it.
  - Built on the official SDK (see "Changed"). `src/tools.ts` is transport-independent, which
    is what made that migration a replacement of the protocol layer alone.
  - 52 tests: the tool surface, the protocol, hostile arguments, and structural guarantees
    (no `child_process`, no `eval`, no filesystem, no sockets, read-only, deterministic).
- `pnpm mcp` starts the server.

- **The complete deterministic workflow in the web app**: environment selection (operating
  system, with macOS and Windows shown as not-yet-supported rather than hidden), optional
  role presets, application detail with every verified source and who packages it, and a
  **setup-plan view** showing the generated commands with privileged steps marked, manual
  steps explained, applications with no verified route stated plainly, and copy-to-clipboard
  per command or for the whole script. The page never executes anything.
- **Deterministic role/use-case presets** (`packages/catalog`): curated role →
  application-id bundles for General use, Student, Developer, Web developer and DevOps.
  Fixed, reviewable lists — no model, no scoring. Applying one *adds* to the selection rather
  than replacing it. Validated, and the health endpoint now fails if a preset names an
  application the catalog no longer has. PRD §15's AI/ML Developer, Designer and Video Editor
  are deliberately absent: the catalog has no applications that would honestly serve them.
- `GET /api/catalog/roles` and `GET /api/catalog/roles/:id`; `/health` is now also served at
  `/api/health` so one proxy rule covers the whole API.
- Loading, empty and error states throughout, including a distinct "the API is not reachable"
  state that names the command to start it.
- `apps/web` tests (8) covering the API client's contract, on the runner the other workspaces
  already use — no new test framework.

- **`packages/installer` — the deterministic core.** Resolution, setup-plan generation and
  command generation as three pure functions over `(catalog, environment)`, with no I/O and
  no execution. PRD §22's source-trust hierarchy is encoded explicitly and tested rule by
  rule; a resolution records which source won, why, and what was rejected. Sources needing a
  third-party repository are skipped in favour of the vendor's own instructions, so a
  generated command never fails on a clean system (provisional — see `docs/technical-audit.md`
  §9). Manual steps and applications with no verified route are reported, never dropped.
- **`apps/server` — a read-only planning API.** `/health` (with catalog integrity),
  `/api/applications[/:id]`, `/api/catalog/{categories,environments,stats}`, `POST /api/plan`
  and `POST /api/plan/resolve`. Structured JSON logging, per-request correlation ids, a
  closed set of error codes, a 16 kB body cap and a 200-id selection cap. It plans and
  validates; **it never executes**, and a test asserts no module in the workspace imports
  `child_process`.
- **Environment model** in `packages/catalog`: `Environment`, `createEnvironment`,
  `parseEnvironment`, and an explicit `os` axis with `'linux'` as its only value so a second
  operating system is a data problem later rather than a refactor. The
  distribution↔ecosystem mapping now lives in exactly one place, which the validator reuses.
- **Verification metadata**: optional `verify: { binary }` per application, populated for 26
  of 31 entries. A closed shape with one field on purpose — a free-text check *command* is
  precisely the field through which arbitrary strings would reach a shell. Verification
  commands come from one fixed template, `command -v <binary>`.
- Read-only catalog queries (`findApplication`, `searchApplications`) shared by every
  consumer, so the API and the web app cannot answer the same question differently.
- **102 new tests** (20 → 122): the catalog suite grew to 37, `packages/installer` has 44,
  and `apps/server` has 41 API integration tests against the real application. Includes
  golden command output per package manager and an assertion that no generated command can
  contain a shell metacharacter on any supported distribution.

- `docs/product-requirements.md` — the product requirements document (vision, scope, MVP
  definition, long-term architecture).
- `docs/technical-audit.md` — a full audit of the repository against the PRD and README:
  gap analysis, documentation audit, architectural risks, the AI-to-future-scope record,
  the prioritised P0/P1/P2/Future backlog, and the resolved product decisions.

- Open-source project files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `SUPPORT.md`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `NOTICE`, and
  this changelog.
- GitHub contribution tooling: issue templates (bug, feature, documentation), a pull
  request template, `CODEOWNERS`, Dependabot configuration, and a CI workflow running
  install, lint, typecheck, test and build on Node 20 and 22.
- ESLint across the whole repository via a single flat config (`eslint.config.js`), wired
  to `pnpm lint`.
- `apps/server/.env.example` and validated environment configuration
  (`apps/server/src/config/env.ts`): `PORT` and `NODE_ENV` are checked at startup and an
  invalid value fails with an explanatory error.
- READMEs for every workspace, `docs/development.md`, and contributor guides for adding an
  application and adding a distribution in `docs/catalog.md`.
- Honest status documents for the unimplemented layers: `docs/ai.md`, `docs/mcp.md`,
  `docs/agent.md` (previously empty files).
- `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes`.

### Changed

- **MCP argument limits moved from hand-written checks into the Zod schemas** — the catalog-id
  pattern, the 100-character query cap, the 200-id selection cap and the 4096-character
  command cap. The SDK now enforces them before a handler runs *and* publishes them in the
  JSON Schema clients read, so a host can see the rules instead of discovering them from an
  error. `packages/mcp/src/validate.ts` keeps only what a schema cannot express: catalog
  existence, deduplication, and building a validated `Environment`.
- Three hand-rolled recursive directory walkers in tests replaced with
  `readdirSync(dir, { recursive: true })`, each now asserting it actually scanned something
  so the structural tests cannot pass vacuously.

- **The MCP layer now uses the official MCP TypeScript SDK** (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`
  v2, negotiating protocol revisions through `2025-11-25`), replacing the hand-written
  JSON-RPC and stdio
  implementation. Two things changed the calculus behind the original decision: v2 **split the
  monolithic `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`** into scoped packages, so a server now needs three
  dependencies rather than seventeen and the OAuth/process-spawning code is in the *client*
  package; and the hand-written server negotiated protocol versions only up to `2025-06-18`,
  with no knowledge of the current spec. `src/protocol.ts` and the hand-rolled framing in
  `src/server.ts` are gone; the tools themselves were kept.
- Tool input schemas are now **Zod and strict**. The SDK derives the JSON Schema clients see
  and validates arguments before a handler runs, so unknown arguments are rejected rather than
  ignored — a host that invents a `command` field is told so.
- Every tool now carries **annotations** (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint: false`,
  `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint: false`) and a `title`, stating the security posture in the
  protocol's own vocabulary, and returns `structuredContent` alongside text.
- `createConfigShellServer()` binds **no transport**, so stdio today and Streamable HTTP later
  are the same tools with a different binding.
- MCP tests are now interoperability tests: the **official MCP client** connects to the server
  over the real protocol, and a second test spawns the binary over stdio exactly as a host
  does. The hand-written protocol unit tests were deleted with the code they covered.
- The application-id pattern now lives in `@configshell/catalog` (`APPLICATION_ID_PATTERN`,
  `isApplicationIdShape`) instead of being written out separately in the API server — three
  consumers, one rule.
- `eslint.config.js` allows `any` in test files only. Tests assert on deliberately untyped
  payloads, where the assertion *is* the type check; source keeps the stricter rule.

- **The web app now calls the API** to generate setup plans. The catalog stays compiled into
  the bundle, so browsing, search and presets work with no server; plan generation goes to
  the one implementation of command generation rather than shipping a second copy of that
  security-critical code to the browser.
- **The web dev server moved to port 5173**, so it no longer collides with the API on 3000.
  `pnpm dev` starts both; `pnpm dev:web` starts the web app alone. Vite proxies `/api`.
- The "Continue" button is real: it builds the setup plan, and when it cannot, the tooltip
  says which of the two preconditions is missing.
- Catalog search in the web app now uses the shared `searchApplications` from
  `packages/catalog`, so it matches on `id` too — "vscode" finds Visual Studio Code.
- Each verification command now names the application it checks, instead of four consecutive
  lines all reading "Verify 4 installations".
- A step's precondition note (the Flathub remote) now travels on its own rendered command
  rather than being matched up by the consumer, which had attached it to the APT command too.
- **Accessibility fixes:** the distribution radios had no accessible name at all — a
  `<label for>` does not name a `<button role="radio">`, so screen readers announced four
  unnamed radios. Preset buttons now name their role rather than five buttons all reading
  "Add 5 apps".

- `apps/server` runs under `tsx` so it can import the workspace's TypeScript packages
  directly; the monorepo still has no build step. Its `tsconfig.json` typechecks the server
  source, so misuse of the catalog or installer APIs is caught by `pnpm typecheck`.
- `origin` is now load-bearing rather than descriptive: it drives source preference and, for
  `apt`/`dnf`/`pacman`, whether a source is usable at all.
- Root `typecheck` and `test` scripts cover the two new workspaces; CI runs them unchanged.

- **Renamed the project to ConfigShell** throughout: workspace package names, the npm scope
  (`@linux-app-platform/*` → `@configshell/*`), the page title, UI copy, and every
  repository URL.
- **Product direction: the core release is built without external AI model integration.**
  AI recommendations and explainability move to Future; role/use-case selection is
  retained but will be satisfied deterministically with curated catalog bundles. MCP is
  *not* removed — it is retained as a separate future integration layer and `docs/mcp.md`
  is reframed so it no longer depends on AI existing. The PRD was amended accordingly
  (MVP list, version ladder, success criteria).
- Community-health documents are now consistently referenced at their real location under
  `docs/`; all 50 broken relative links left by the earlier move have been repaired.
- `docs/security.md` renamed to `docs/security-model.md`. It previously collided with
  `docs/SECURITY.md` on case-insensitive filesystems, which breaks clones on macOS and
  Windows.
- Corrected stale PRD claims: Turborepo was never installed, and the AI backend "structure"
  is a set of 0-byte placeholder files.

- `apps/server` now starts successfully. It previously crashed immediately with
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` because it imported `dotenv` without declaring it; `dotenv` is now
  a declared dependency and the port comes from validated configuration.
- The web workspace is named `web` (was `react-example`, a scaffold leftover), so
  `pnpm --filter web …` now works. Root scripts use the name-based filter.
- `lint` scripts that ran `tsc --noEmit` were renamed to `typecheck`; `pnpm lint` is now
  actually ESLint. New root scripts: `typecheck` and `check`.
- `apps/web`'s `clean` script no longer deletes `server.js`, which is a source file.
- Dependency placement: Vite plugins moved to `devDependencies`.
- `apps/web`'s static server now uses Express 5 (matching `apps/server`), which clears two
  moderate `qs` advisories that came in through Express 4 — `pnpm audit` is now clean. Its
  SPA fallback is written as middleware instead of an `app.get('*')` wildcard, which
  Express 5 no longer accepts.

### Removed

- **Empty placeholder files that made the repository look more complete than it is**:
  `apps/server/controllers/ai.controller.js`, `services/ai.service.js`, `routes/ai.routes.js`
  and `middleware/auth.middleware.js` were all 0 bytes, sitting in directories otherwise full
  of working code. The AI design is in `docs/ai.md`, which is where it belongs until there is
  something to put in a file. `packages/ai/src/` (an empty directory) went too; the package
  itself stays, since its README's first line says it is a placeholder.
- `apps/web/server.js` and `apps/web`'s `express` dependency — the API server now serves the
  built web app, so a second static server had no reason to exist.

- **Dead AI Studio scaffolding**: `aistudioMediaPlugin` from `apps/web/vite.config.ts` (60
  lines of dev-server middleware serving `public/assets/aistudio/`, a directory whose only
  content was a `.gitignore` containing `*`), the directory itself, and
  `apps/web/metadata.json` — an AI Studio manifest with no readers anywhere in the repo.
- `apps/server/services/app.service.js` (one function, one caller — inlined into its
  controller), `apps/server/config/index.js` (a re-export barrel with one importer),
  `logger.debug` (no callers), the `REQUIRES_LOCAL_AGENT` error code (declared, never thrown
  — by design it cannot be), and speculative injectable-collection parameters on
  `findApplication`, `findRole`, `applicationsForRole` and `searchApplications` that no
  caller ever passed.

- `nodemon` from `apps/server` — `tsx watch` covers it.

- `MAJOR_CAPABILITY_SERVER_SIDE_GEMINI_API` from `apps/web/metadata.json` — the only place
  in the repository that asserted a live model dependency, for a feature that does not
  exist.
- The "AI-native" tagline from `README.md` and the root `package.json` description.

- Unused dependencies from `apps/web`: `@google/genai`, `motion`, `dotenv`, `autoprefixer`,
  `esbuild`, `tsx`, and a duplicate `vite` entry.
- Unused, unreferenced images from `apps/web/public/` (`BG.png` and a grid-texture JPEG) —
  scaffold leftovers of unclear provenance.
- The empty `turbo.json`. Turborepo was never installed and root pnpm scripts orchestrate
  the workspaces; the file only implied a pipeline that did not exist.
- `apps/server`'s `lint` and `check` scripts, which invoked an ESLint that was not
  installed and always failed. Linting now runs from the repository root.

### Fixed

- **The access log recorded the wrong path for every routed request.** Express rewrites
  `req.url` when a request enters a mounted router, and the finish handler read `req.path`
  afterwards — so `GET /api/applications` was logged as `GET /`, and only unmatched requests
  (400s and 404s) logged correctly. The path is now captured from `originalUrl` before
  routing. Found by reading the log during an integration audit rather than by a test, so
  two regression tests were added alongside the fix.

- **The application detail view disagreed with the setup plan.** It computed which
  installation sources applied to a distribution itself, and that local copy did not know
  that a vendor package-manager source needs a third-party repository added first. On Ubuntu
  it highlighted VS Code's `apt` source as applicable while the plan installed the Snap. The
  duplicated logic is gone; the view now asks the resolver through the API and shows its
  reason per source, plus which one would actually be used.
- **`GET /api/applications/:id` and `POST /api/plan` returned different shapes for the same
  resolution** — the former leaked the raw installer type (nested sources, the policy's
  internal rank integer, and the application repeated inside its own resolution). Both now
  use one shared presenter, and a test asserts the two shapes are identical.
- A resolution's `considered` entries now report `eligible: boolean` rather than the policy's
  internal `rank`, matching what the MCP adapter already emitted. A resolution reads the same
  however it was requested.
- **Added an error boundary**, so a render error degrades to a message rather than a blank
  page. The fallback deliberately uses no design-system components, since the thing that
  broke may be the design system.

- Documentation contradictions in `README.md` (root scripts described as unwired, the
  `LICENSE` file described as missing, empty docs described as written).

## Before this changelog

Work up to this point is recorded in the git history rather than here. In summary:

- **Phase 1** — the web UI foundation: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 +
  shadcn/ui, Linux detection indicator, distribution selector, application browser with
  search and category filtering, selection summary, dark/light theme.
- **Phase 2** — `packages/catalog`: 31 verified applications with 116 verified installation
  sources, the data model, dependency-free validation, and the repository's first test
  suite. The web app's local catalog fixture was deleted in favour of it.

## Versioning

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR** — incompatible changes: removing or renaming a catalog field, changing the
  meaning of an existing one, breaking a package's public API, or removing a documented
  command.
- **MINOR** — backwards-compatible functionality: new catalog entries or applications, a
  new distribution, new UI capabilities, new optional configuration.
- **PATCH** — backwards-compatible fixes: corrections to catalog data, bug fixes,
  documentation and tooling fixes.

While the version is `0.x`, a MINOR bump may include a breaking change — such changes are
called out explicitly in the entry, marked **BREAKING**. The first tagged release is
expected to be `0.1.0`; `1.0.0` is not planned until the V1 flow (through terminal command
generation) is complete.

Releases are cut by the repository owner: move the `[Unreleased]` entries under a new
`## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, bump the versions in the affected `package.json` files,
tag the commit `vx.y.z`, and publish a GitHub release pointing at that section.
