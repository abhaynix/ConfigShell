An open-source Linux software discovery and setup-plan generator.

ConfigShell helps users discover Linux applications, understand how compatible those
applications are with their system, and — with explicit consent — generate a validated
setup plan they run themselves. The core is **deterministic**: every recommendation and
every command comes from the verified catalog, not from a model.

AI is *stated future work*, not a dependency. When it lands it will reason about software
and propose plans; it will never be granted unrestricted access to the operating system,
and the product must remain fully usable without it.

## What this project is

A curated catalog of Linux applications plus an interface for choosing the ones you want —
with, eventually, a safe path from "I want these applications" to "they are installed",
that never puts a shell behind a web page.

**Why it exists.** Setting up a fresh Linux system means identifying your distribution,
knowing its package ecosystem, checking whether each application is in the default
repositories, finding the right installation method, and copying commands from a dozen
websites. The information is scattered, often outdated, and frequently wrong for your
distribution specifically. This project's answer is a small, *verified* catalog and a flow
that is honest about what it does not know.

The intended end-to-end experience:

1. **Discover** Linux applications from a curated catalog.
2. **Understand** compatibility with your system (distribution, architecture, desktop
   environment, package managers, installed software).
3. **Search and filter** by name, category, and other attributes.
4. **Select** multiple applications.
5. **Generate a safe installation plan** that resolves each application against the catalog.
6. **Eventually** use AI to recommend and plan workflows, expose controlled capabilities
   through MCP, and let a local Linux agent perform validated system operations.

### Non-negotiable safety principles

- The browser **never** directly executes arbitrary shell commands.
- AI **never** receives unrestricted system access.
- System-changing operations must go through a **trusted local agent** with validation and
  explicit user confirmation.
- Applications must resolve against the **trusted catalog** — untrusted manifests are never
  installed.

See [Security](#security) and [`docs/security-model.md`](docs/security-model.md) for the full model.

## What exists today

- **The full deterministic workflow in the browser** (`apps/web`) — Vite + React 19 +
  TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) (Radix UI base):
  environment selection (with an honest browser-only "does this look like Linux" hint, and
  macOS/Windows shown as not-yet-supported), optional role presets, a searchable and
  filterable application browser, per-application detail showing every verified source and
  who packages it, a selection summary (sidebar on desktop, sheet + sticky bar on mobile),
  and a **setup-plan view with the generated commands** — privileged steps marked, manual
  steps explained, copy-to-clipboard. Dark/light theme, dark by default.
  **The page never executes anything**; it displays commands you run yourself.

- **A real, verified application catalog** (`packages/catalog`) — 160 applications across
  eight categories, with 512 installation sources whose identifiers were each checked
  against an authoritative source (the distribution's own package database, Flathub, the
  Snap Store, or vendor documentation). It is the single source of truth for application
  metadata; the web app consumes it via `@configshell/catalog` and owns no
  application data of its own. Support is explicit per distribution rather than assumed,
  unverified identifiers are omitted rather than guessed, version numbers are never
  recorded, and each source is labelled `distro` / `vendor` / `community` so third-party
  repackagings are not presented as vendor-official. The catalog is inert descriptive data:
  it contains **no commands**, and nothing acts on it yet. See
  [`docs/catalog.md`](docs/catalog.md).

- **The deterministic core** (`packages/installer`) — resolution, setup-plan generation and
  command generation, as three pure functions with no I/O and no execution. Given a
  selection and an environment it picks an installation source (and records why, and what it
  rejected), builds an ordered plan as structured data, and renders the exact commands a user
  would run. Sources needing a third-party repository are deliberately skipped in favour of
  the vendor's own instructions, so a generated command never fails on a clean system. 44
  tests, including that no generated command can contain a shell metacharacter.

- **A read-only planning API** (`apps/server`) — Express, with a health endpoint, catalog
  browse/search/lookup, role presets, supported-environment discovery, and `POST /api/plan`.
  The web app calls it to generate plans. It **plans and validates; it never executes** —
  there is no `child_process` import in the workspace and a test asserts there never is one.
  No database, no authentication, no sessions. 45 tests.

- **An MCP server** (`packages/mcp`) — ConfigShell's external integration boundary, built on
  the **official MCP TypeScript SDK** (`@modelcontextprotocol/server` v2, protocol revisions
  through `2025-11-25`).
  Seven read-only, deterministic tools over stdio — environment discovery, catalog search,
  application detail, role presets, compatibility checking, setup-plan generation and plan
  validation — plus two reference resources and a workflow prompt. An MCP-capable AI host
  (Claude, Cursor, VS Code) does the reasoning; ConfigShell supplies trusted data and
  deterministic operations, with **no model or provider SDK anywhere in the repository**.
  `detect_system`, `check_installed` and `execute_setup` are deliberately **absent, not
  stubbed** — they belong to the local agent. Interoperability is verified by connecting the
  official MCP client over the real protocol. See [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md).

- **Deterministic role presets** (`packages/catalog`) — curated role → application-id
  bundles (General use, Student, Developer, Web developer, DevOps). Fixed, reviewable lists.
  **No model is involved anywhere.**

- **Repository tooling** — pnpm workspaces, repository-wide ESLint, per-workspace
  typechecking, 285 tests across seven workspaces, and CI that runs all of it on Node 20
  and 22.

**Not implemented (planned):** system detection beyond "does the browser look like Linux",
application icons, selection persistence across reloads, search by tags and aliases,
component-level tests for the web app, authorization for the remote MCP endpoint, AI
features, the local Linux agent, database storage, and authentication. See
[`ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

*There is no screenshot or demo in this README yet — run it locally with `pnpm dev`; it
takes about a minute.*

## Architecture

The platform is designed around a strict separation of layers:

```
UI                 ✻  React web application
   ↓
Application Catalog   Curated application data, independent of the UI
   ↓
System Detection      What the user's Linux system looks like
   ↓
AI / Planning         Recommendation, compatibility, and plan generation
   ↓
MCP                   A controlled, tool-based interface for external clients
   ↓
Local Agent           Runs on the user's machine — Future scope, nothing implements it
   ↓
Validated System
Operation             The only layer that can change the system
```

**The catalog, the interface, the deterministic planning core between them, and the MCP
integration boundary exist.** AI and the local agent do not:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CATALOG["packages/catalog<br/>verified application data"] -- "bundled at build time" --> WEB["apps/web<br/>React interface"]
    CATALOG --> INSTALLER["packages/installer<br/>resolve · plan · commands"]
    INSTALLER --> SERVER["apps/server<br/>read-only planning API"]
    INSTALLER --> MCP["packages/mcp<br/>read-only MCP tools"]
    WEB -- "POST /api/plan" --> SERVER
    SERVER -- "mounts /mcp" --> MCP
    MCP -. "stdio · Streamable HTTP" .-> HOST["external AI host"]
    SERVER -. "does not exist" .-> REST["AI layer · local agent"]
```

Two paths on purpose: the catalog is **compiled into** the web bundle, so browsing, search
and presets work with no server and there is no catalog-fetch path to intercept. Plan
generation goes over HTTP to the one implementation of command generation, rather than
shipping that security-critical code to the browser as a second copy.

Each layer is intentionally decoupled so security boundaries can be enforced at each hop:
nothing downstream runs arbitrary input, and nothing upstream can touch the operating
system directly. Full detail — including what is implemented versus planned — is in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Current V1 scope

V1 is a **Ninite-style installer-command generator, not an installer**: it stops at
generating a terminal command that the user copies and runs themselves.

```
Website → Linux detection state → Distribution selection → Application catalog
→ Application selection → Installer resolution → Terminal command generation
→ Copy to terminal → user runs it themselves
```

| Piece | Status |
| ----- | ------ |
| Linux application discovery (UI + verified catalog) | **implemented** |
| Manual distribution selection (Ubuntu / Debian / Fedora / Arch / openSUSE) | **implemented** |
| Browser-only "looks like Linux" detection | **implemented** |
| Search | **implemented** |
| Category filtering | **implemented** |
| Application selection + selection summary | **implemented** |
| Responsive interface | **implemented** |
| Dark/light theme toggle (dark by default) | **implemented** |
| Verified application catalog (31 apps, metadata only) | **implemented** |
| Installer resolution (APT/DNF/Pacman/Flatpak/Snap) | **implemented** (`packages/installer`) |
| Setup-plan generation, ordered and deterministic | **implemented** (`packages/installer`) |
| Terminal command generation | **implemented** (`packages/installer`) |
| Installation verification commands | **implemented** (`packages/installer`) |
| Read-only planning API | **implemented** (`apps/server`) |
| Role / use-case presets (deterministic, no model) | **implemented** (`packages/catalog`) |
| Application detail view | **implemented** (`apps/web`) |
| Setup-plan UI, command display, copy to clipboard | **implemented** (`apps/web`) |
| Selection persistence across reloads | not started |
| Application icons | not started |

V1 does **not** include real package installation, arbitrary shell execution, AI, or a
local agent — those are out of scope for V1 entirely. MCP was outside V1 and has since been
built: it is a read-only boundary over the same core, and it executes nothing.

### Important distro detection rule

Normal browser APIs cannot reliably identify which Linux distribution a visitor is running.
`apps/web/src/hooks/useLinuxDetection.ts` only ever reports whether the browser *looks like*
Linux (and explicitly excludes Android, which also reports "Linux" in its user agent) —
never a specific distribution. Exact distribution is always a manual, explicit choice in the
selector. True system-level distro detection is a future local-agent capability, not a
browser one.

### Application catalog categories

Browsers · Code Editors · CLI Tools · Development · Utilities · Media · Communication

Every application belongs to exactly one category. See
[`docs/catalog.md`](docs/catalog.md).

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 20** (developed on 20 and 22; CI runs both)
- **pnpm 9.15.5** (pinned in `package.json` via `packageManager`)
- git

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.15.5 --activate
```

Nothing in this repository requires root, installs system packages, or modifies your
machine.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AbhiDevepl/configshell.git
cd configshell
pnpm install
```

## Environment setup

**Optional.** The web app reads no environment variables and the server starts without any.
For the server:

```sh
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
```

| Variable | Used by | Required | Default |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| `PORT` | `apps/server` — the API, and the built web app when one exists | no | `3000` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `apps/server` | no | `development` |
| `DISABLE_HMR` | `apps/web` dev server | no | unset |

Invalid values fail server startup with an explanatory error rather than being ignored.
There are deliberately **no** AI keys, database URLs, or auth secrets — nothing in the
repository implements a feature that needs one. `.env` files are git-ignored; never put a
real secret in a `.env.example`. Details in [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md).

## Development

```sh
pnpm dev                    # web app → http://localhost:5173, API → http://localhost:3000
```

`pnpm dev` runs **both** processes. The web app generates setup plans by calling the API, so
browsing works without it but the plan step does not — and the UI says so plainly rather than
failing quietly. Vite proxies `/api` to the API server, so the browser stays on one origin
and there is no CORS configuration.

Per workspace:

```sh
pnpm dev:web                # web app only, port 5173 (plan step needs the API)
pnpm --filter web dev       # the same thing
pnpm --filter web build     # production build → apps/web/dist
pnpm --filter web preview   # preview the production build (Vite, no API)
pnpm --filter server dev    # planning API (tsx watch) — http://localhost:3000/health
```

> The web dev server is on 5173 and the API on 3000, so they no longer collide.

### Checks

```sh
pnpm check       # lint → typecheck → test → build (what CI runs)

pnpm lint        # ESLint across the repository
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit for every TypeScript workspace
pnpm test        # 285 tests across seven workspaces
pnpm build       # production build of apps/web → apps/web/dist
```

There is no formatter to run — `.editorconfig` covers the basics; match the file you are
editing.

## Running the built app

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm start       # http://localhost:3000 — the whole product on one port
```

`pnpm start` runs the API server, which also serves `apps/web/dist` when a build exists. One
process, one port: the web app and the API share an origin, which is what the web app needs
since it calls the API for anything the resolver decides. There is no proxy to configure and
no CORS.

Without a build the API still runs on its own and serves JSON only — useful for a CLI or MCP
client that does not need the interface.

## Run with Docker

Production Docker images and a Compose stack package the same product — one container
serves the web app, the API and the MCP endpoint, exactly as `pnpm build && pnpm start` does:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build   # http://localhost:3000 (override host port: API_PORT=8080 ...)
```

An optional nginx reverse-proxy front is provided for deployments that want a dedicated web
tier; the MCP stdio tool is packaged separately for MCP hosts that launch it as a container.
Everything — images, topologies, configuration, security, and the exact validation commands —
is in [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md).

## Testing

**285 tests** across seven workspaces, on Node's built-in runner via `tsx`.

```sh
pnpm test        # all of them
pnpm check       # lint → typecheck → test → build, what CI runs
```

They exercise real data and the real application rather than fixtures and mocks: the catalog
suite validates all 160 entries, the installer suite asserts no generated command can contain
a shell metacharacter on any distribution, the server suite drives the actual Express app,
and the MCP suite connects the **official MCP client** over the real protocol.

Full detail — per-workspace coverage, the security test cases, and an honest list of what is
**not** tested — is in [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and the most useful ones right now are catalog additions, tests,
and documentation fixes.

- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) — setup, branch and commit conventions, pull request
  process, and what reviewers look for.
- [`.github/GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md`](.github/GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md) — 16 real tasks with the
  files each one touches.
- [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) — expected conduct in every project space.
- [`MAINTAINERS.md`](docs/MAINTAINERS.md) — who maintains what and who decides what.
- [`SUPPORT.md`](docs/SUPPORT.md) — where questions go.

House rules, in short: keep features modular, avoid unnecessary dependencies, keep catalog
data separate from the UI, never introduce unsafe command execution, add tests for
important functionality, keep pull requests focused, and never document or display
functionality that does not exist.

---

## Security

Security is a design constraint, not an afterthought:

- **No arbitrary shell execution from the browser.**
- **No remote sudo.** Privileged operations are never exposed over a remote interface.
- **No unrestricted command execution.** All operations are scoped and validated.
- **AI cannot control the operating system.** It plans and recommends; it never executes.
- **Installation requests must be validated** before execution.
- **Applications must resolve against the trusted catalog.**
- **System-changing operations require explicit user confirmation.**
- **Privileged operations belong in the local agent** — the only component allowed to change
  a system.
- **Security-sensitive operations are logged** and auditable.

The full model is in [`docs/security-model.md`](docs/security-model.md). To **report a vulnerability**,
follow [`SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md) — not a public issue.
